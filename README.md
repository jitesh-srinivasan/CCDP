# CCDP System Pragyaan 2022-2023 

The CCDP System is a program that can help in the detection of criminals and detection of
items that can be classified as weapons.

The Crime rates and Violence rates have raised exponentially across the globe, especially
during the COVID Era.

This rise in Violence over the decade has been dubbed the 'Shadow Pandemic'.
Wouldn't it be better if we detect these Violent acts that happen in public via Real Time CCTV
footage and notify the appropriate authorities immediately?

That is what our project intends to do.

The Entire Project is coded in Python, utilizing Computer Vision Algorithms, Convolutional
Neural Nets, HOG Classifiers and others
We will first extract frames from our webcam and send it to processing to our 2 Major
Components

These 2 Major components are:
1. The Facial Recognition System that searches for known criminals.
This Face Recognition System will made using a module known as DLIB, that uses a
Computer Vision technique known as HOG CASCADES to detect known criminals in Real
Time footage and raise appropriate alarms

2. Weapon Detection System.
This System is trained using a custom dataset on a YOLOV3 (You Only Look Once V3)

USECASES:
1. It can be used in houses for the Detection of Domestic Violence.
2. It can be used in shops for the prevention of Theft.
3. It can be used in government offices which are prone to Criminal activities and bombing.
4. In Schools, which are prone to Mass Shootings.
5. in Riots, Political Meets, Mass Protests, and Any Public Assemblies
